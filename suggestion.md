# Suggestions for Improving the FloodGPT Application

Here are some suggestions to enhance the FloodGPT application, focusing on configuration, error handling, frontend, code structure, testing, and security.

## 1. Configuration Management

The application currently has some hardcoded values. Moving these to a configuration file or environment variables will make the application more flexible and easier to configure for different environments.

**Suggestion:**

- In `main_agent.py`, the database URI is hardcoded: `db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///db/analytics.db")`. This should be loaded from an environment variable.
- The LLM model name in `llm_config.py` and `main_agent.py` is also hardcoded. This could be moved to a configuration file or environment variables.

**Example:**

In your `.env` file:
```
DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///db/analytics.db"
LLM_MODEL_NAME="gemini-1.5-flash"
```

In `main_agent.py`:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

DATABASE_URI = os.getenv("DATABASE_URI")
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(DATABASE_URI)
```

## 2. Enhanced Error Handling

The current error handling is basic. Providing more specific error messages to the user on the frontend would improve the user experience.

**Suggestion:**

- In `main_agent.py`, expand the `AgentState` to include more detailed error information.
- In `api.py`, the `stream_agent_endpoint` should send different error events based on the type of error.
- The frontend should then display these error messages to the user in a clear and understandable way.

## 3. Frontend Improvements

The frontend is a single HTML file. While simple, it could be improved for better user experience and maintainability.

**Suggestions:**

- **Structure:** Separate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into their own files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
- **Interactivity:**
    - Add a loading spinner or progress indicator that updates based on the events received from the backend.
    - Display results in a more structured and visually appealing way. For example, use tabs for the table, visualization, and insight.
- **User Control:** Allow users to choose the type of visualization (e.g., from a dropdown list of recommended charts).

## 4. Code Structure and Maintainability

The backend code could be more modular.

**Suggestions:**

- **`main_agent.py`:** This file is doing a lot. The node functions could be grouped into logical files. For example, all SQL-related nodes could go into a `sql_nodes.py` file.
- **`tools.py`:** This file has many functions. It could be split into smaller, more focused modules like `sql_tools.py`, `validation_tools.py`, and `insight_tools.py`.

## 5. Testing

The project lacks an automated test suite. Adding tests would significantly improve the application's reliability and make future development easier.

**Suggestions:**

- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for the functions in `tools.py` and `formatter.py`. Use a testing framework like `pytest`.
- **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests for the LangGraph agent in `main_agent.py` to ensure the nodes work together as expected.

## 6. Security Enhancements

Security is critical, especially when dealing with natural language queries that are converted to SQL.

**Suggestions:**

- **Input Validation:** The keyword-based blacklist in `validate_question_node` is a good first step, but it's not foolproof. Consider using a more robust library for input sanitization and validation.
- **SQL Injection:** While there is a SQL validation step, the safest approach is to avoid constructing SQL queries from strings directly. Consider using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like SQLAlchemy Core or using parameterized queries if possible with the current architecture. This would be a significant change but would provide the best protection against SQL injection.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate a tool like `pip-audit` or `safety` into your development workflow to check for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

## 7. Add Linter and Formatter

To ensure code quality and consistency, it's a good practice to use a linter and a code formatter.

**Suggestion:**

- **Linter:** Use a linter like `Ruff` or `Flake8` to check for code style and potential errors.
- **Formatter:** Use a code formatter like `Black` to automatically format the code, ensuring a consistent style across the project.

You can add these to your `pyproject.toml` and configure them to run automatically, for example, with pre-commit hooks.

By implementing these suggestions, the FloodGPT application can become more robust, secure, maintainable, and user-friendly.
